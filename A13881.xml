            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Novve ſeinge that he hathe framed a Bezaleel for vs, to make the veſſels and inſtrumentes off the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, he ſeemeth not as yet to haue cleane left, off to thinke, off repayringe the ruines off our Church. For

            <p>But hereoff I truſt we ſhall ſpeake more at large he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reafter. Now to goe forwarde / Let vs admitte bothe: That the Biſhoppe hath this authoritie / and that he may appointe whome he liſte to excute it for him: yet how can we thincke it lawfull that a man ſhould be admitted to ordinarie and perpetuall office in the churche / without a right and lawfull calling (which as after ſhalbe declared / conſiſteth in theſe twoe poyntes / fyrſt / that he be choſen / and after that he be ordeined) ſeing it is generall / and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto all / without exception who doe bare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny office in the churche / which I laide in the begynning as the foundacion off all this diſputacion / that is to ſaie that no man take this honor vnto him but he that is called vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yt as was Aaron?</p>
            <p>But ſeing Archdeacons and Channcellors are apoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted onlie by the Biſhoppes pleaſure / and the other vnder-officiers by theres / and ſeing that nothing is vſed in the apointing off them which ſhalbe ſhewed to be neceſſarie in the calling to any eccleaſticall function / Seing there is no Election / no praiers / no Ordeining / no laiing on off handes and ſuche life as bothe are wont and owght to be vſed in ſuch a matter / naie ſeing there is not ſo much as an othe geuen them without the which no office off any waite in the common wealthe is committed to any man: It muſt nedes be confeſſed as the thing it ſelfe declareth / and I haue proued by ſure and vndoubted argumentes / That all this rabble and company exerciſe authoritie in the churche off God without any lawfull vocacion at all or calling. Wherfore ſeing ſo many voluntarie officers
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19106:21"/> haue without any lawfull calling taken vpon them the go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uernment off the churche / whereby as I haue ſhewed the wrath off god is moſt greuouſly prouoked againſt vs / why doe we not fiftene yeres after that by the grace off God his holie Goſpell is preached emongeſt vs / whie doe we not I ſaie in the eccleſiaſticall officers that which the Romanes did euerie fyue yeres in all degrees / that is to ſaie / whie doe we not make a ſearche and aſſaie off euerie mans calling / That Right and lawfull authorie being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned from that which is vniuſt and vnlawfull / thoſe impudent officers who were choſen by them ſelues or crepte in at the backe dore / and were not called thereunto by the authoritie off God and off his churche / maie be compelled to leaue there places / and be put out off office.</p>
            <p>Therfore let enquirie be made into euerie mans cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling / Let them ſhewe how they were choſen and ordeined as the leters and ſeale off ther calling / let them rehearſe there genealogies and the race off there deſcente / let them bring there roddes and ſet them before the Arcke off God And they who cannot ſhewe the markes and tokens off there Creacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Election / They that cannot fetche there Pedigree from Aaaron / and whoſe roddes remaine deade before the Arcke / and neyther bloſſome nor floriſhe / let them by the moſt iuſt authoritie off the worde off God be diſplaced and put out off thoſe offices which they moſt vniuſtlie and wrongfully haue deſyred and vſurped And thus muche maie be ſufficient to proue the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye off a lawfull vocacion and calling.</p>
            <p>Now let vs ſee the / vſe / fruite / and com<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>oditie off the ſame: which ſemeth to me to be ſo greate / that althoughe there were no puniſhement for the neglecte and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pte off yt / yet yt were to be taried and waited for / for the meruailous vſe and commoditie that yt bringeth with yt. For what can ſo ſtrengthen a man againſt all daungers
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19106:21"/> which hang ouer hym (diſcharging his dewtie faithfully) as the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce that he is placed in that ſtanding by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement and authoritie off god / which as it pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceth him / ſo it will be alwaies readie to defend him aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſt the enmyties and lieng in waite off all men. For then only the conſcience is not afraide off any winde or weat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her / off any ſtorme or tempeſt / when as it ſtaieth yt ſelfe vpon the lorde / and followeth him in that waie / wheren he goeth before.</p>
            <p>Furthermore / they that are gouerned / can by no mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes better be browght to doe there dewtie a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d perſuaded to doe that which they owght / then when they vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that it is the lordes will and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t whoſe embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dor the myniſter is.

For this cauſe alſo S. Paule ſo diligentlie almoſt in the beginning off euerie Epiſtle calleth him ſelfe an Apoſtle and ſeruante off God.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe alſo he taketh ſo greate paynes in his Epiſtles to the the Corinthes to proue his Apoſtleſhippe / which ſome falſe brethren ſowght to take from him / that by that meanes they might dyminiſhe his credite and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie with the churche.

Which great fruyte and commoditie iff it maie moue vs / let vs tarie a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d waite for the Voice of God to call vs to beare office in his churche and let vs firſt be aſſured moſt plainlie and manifeſtlie / that we are called thereunto by his gouernment and authoritie / Leſt that hauing entred in by the backe dore / we finde the lorde / to be puniſher and Auenger off this ambycion / the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſobedient and vntowarde / and our owne conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhaking and trembling / not only at greate and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowbted daungers / but at euerie bugge / and at the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off euerie leafe.

            <p>Therfore the Apoſtles did at no tyme appoint myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or deacons that afterwards ſhould prouide them ſelues churches wher they ſhould teache / or whos treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they ſhould ouerſee or ells be idle if they would / but they ordeined deacons Paſtors and Elders as the neceſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie off the churche did require.

            <p>But that we may put the caſe that Timothie was Biſhopp at Epheſus / and that we may freely graunt that what ſo euer may apperre to haue beene lawfull for him / to be lawfull alſo for them: Let vs ſee now what the Apoſtle graunted to Timothie. For ſoothe ſay they that he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19106:31"/> might chooſe off his owne authoritie the officers off the church. Let vs then ſee whether it be ſo or not. And here is firſt to be noted that they do yll geue that vnto Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which perteyneth not to Election But to Ordinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the laying on off handes was not wonte to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in chooſinge off any Officers off the churche / But in ordeininge off him.</p>
            <p>Then that we graunt them this alſo / That electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereby is ſignified / I ſay that ther Tyranny and Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly authoritie is by no place more confuted then by this which they bring for them ſelues / which that yt may more cleerly appeere I muſt firſt take away a certen falſe expoſicion which they bringe off this place / that after I may the more eaſyly convince them by the true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall meaninge theroff.</p>
            <p>Heere ſay they Tymothie is warned that he lay not his handes to haſtely vpon any nor communicate with other mens faultes / namely with thers ſay they / who all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe they be vnworthy / ſeeke to enter into the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. An interpretacion very vnfytt either for the wordes off the Apoſtle or for thoſe tymes.

            </p>
            <p>And this is the true and naturall meaninge off this place / wher by yt appeareth that the Apoſtle not only grauntith him no princely authoritie / for then he would not haue warned him to keepe him ſelfe pure from allowynge any ſuche Election / but haue commanded him off his meer authoritie to haue hindered and ſtayed yt / and to haue made the choiſe of the reſt off no effect / by his negatiue voice but contrariwiſe that he was off ſo equall authoritie with the reſt off the Elders / that iff they had choſen one vnfyt in ſome reſpect / yet he could not off his owne meere authoritie haue put hym back nor done any more in this matter / the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any off the reſt. And that he could

Therfore ther is no cauſe which they ſhould make Tymothie the Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thor off this ambition and tyranny.</p>
            <p>Now let vs examin alſo the example off Titus whom they do trewly affirme to haue beene commanded to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Elders in euery citie / but I ſuppoſe no man will thinck that Paule graunted more to Titus / then eyther he and Barnabas / or then all the reſt off the Apoſtles tooke vnto them ſelues neyther iff he had graunted / is it like that Titus being a yonge man and his ſcholler and as it wer his ſonne / would haue vſed it?

Therfore let them confeſſe as the thinges in deed That this miſchife was borne and bred at Rome: which after together with the empier ſpred it ſelfe ouer into all landes.</p>
            <p>But all the queſtion off the choſers off Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call officers is not yet thus ended: For all thoughe I haue concluded owte off the worde off god / that one man can

Neither vnder the lawe perteined it to any but only to ſuche / as miniſtred in the tabernacle and temple: and not to the reſt off the Leuites who were ſcattered throwgh out Iury / and preached the word off god in the Sinagoges. How much leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ought the Interpreters off the goſpell vſe thoſe veiles and ſhadowes in thes daies / wherin as the Apoſtle ſaithe / we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold which open and vncouered face the glory off god.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.10</note> And iff it had bene needefull to haue bene vſed / ther is no doubt but that Chriſt would haue warned his Apoſtles off yt / eſpecially ſeing that theſe thinges were before ſo at large ſet out vnder the lawe. For it is not to be thought that Chriſt was leſſe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in ſhewinge how god would be worſhipped vnder the Goſpell / then Moſes in ſhewing the ſame vnder the lawe. Or that Moſes being a ſeruant was more faithfull in the adminiſtracion off the Lordes houſe / then Chriſt the Sonne and heire in his owne fathers howſe. Therfore to binde the Myniſters to any certen faſhion or forme off apparell hath no grownde off any precept off the goſpell / or comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement out off the word off god.</p>
            <p>They are therfore the inuencions off men: and off what men / but euen off ſuche which haue ſoughte to paint and ador<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne with theſe colors the ſhame off ther wheriſhe idolatrie a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſuperſtition. For as iff they had bene aſhamed off the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie off the goſpell / which they ought rather to haue had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and in honor / They thought good to follow what ſo euer had any ſhewe or oſtentacion in any Religion / and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght it to be vſed to the ſetting forthe off the goſpell. Thus they take out off the lawe allmoſt all ther maſſing apparell by a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe and ridiculous imitation: that hauing an alter and a prieſt they might not want apparell for the ſtage. As for the ſurplice it is notable which is written off hope Siricius who
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19106:70"/> fetcheth the cauſe and originall off yt from Chriſt: and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uethe that we ought to vſe a lin<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>en garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at deuine ſeruice be cauſe Chriſt was buried in a winding ſheete. A notable reaſon ſurely why we ſhould vſe the ſurplice in our churches / but per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture they are ignorant off ther owne antiquities / and the ſurplice is to be thought rather to haue bene borowed by them off certen Egyptian monckes / who vpon the ſkinnes which they vſed to weare for there apparell did weare lyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen garmentes: from whence alſo the name off Surplice ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to come.</p>
            <p>Such like reaſons are to be founde in there wrightinges: but to let paſſe theſe trifles / it is to be lamented that euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges vs who profeſſe the Goſpell / there were ſome / that when the whole papacie was to be conſecrated / and this Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to haue been vowed to deſtruction / accordinge to the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we and curſe off the citie off Hiericho / who being deceiued with the faire and glitteringe ſhewe off the Babyloniſhe gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes / brought them as Acan did into the tentes off Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell. For why do they commande a cope and ſurplice to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in diuine ſeruice? or a Tippet and a Square Cappe to be worne dailie but becauſe they thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k it is of ſome authority with the people / and bringeth ſome eſtimacion to ther office and to ther perſons / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is thought to be of great force / to make a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeeme to be graue a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d off authoritie. For thes be the beſt reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which they are wont to bring: wherby they would ſignifie both that thes ij. ſortes off apparell are not commanded for Religions ſake / and that the abuſing off them heretofore / cannot nor ought not to take away the right vſe off them / which belongeth to comlynes and order / to which ende con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Apoſtles mind they wreſt that place off S. Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le / <hi>That all things are to be done orderly in the church.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.40.</note> But iff they perteine only to a decency and comlynes / what needeth any commandement to be giuen to a miniſter to vſe dailie the tippet and the ſquare cappe / and a Prieſtes gowne / and at devine ſeruice the cope and the ſurplice / ſeing a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter who is ſett ouer the gouernment off the churche / and by
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19106:71"/> the Apoſtles rule ought to be ſuche a one / as not only is able to vſe him ſelffe honeſtlie in euery thing / but alſo ſuche as kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his familie in order / and ought to be an example off all modeſty and honeſt comlines to his flock: who ſuerly iff he be meet for ſuche an office and worthie to handle the word off god / will take heede that he doe not diſhoneſt his worthy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice / by vile and vnhoneſt apparell.</p>
            <p>But ſeing they make no worthie miniſters / but readers and ſeruice ſaiers / yt was needfull / they ſhould appoint them what cappe they ſhould weare: and howe the ſleeues and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers off ther gownes ſhould be made and ſuche like. Althou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe they atteine not this decency and comlines which they pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tend / for often times ther is nothing more filthye and vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt then this kinde off apparell. And iff any can vſe a comely ſquare cappe he can vſe alſo a rounde cap which is as comely / and ſo muche more / as it is fitter for his heade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſquare.</p>
            <p>Therfore ther is no cauſe to preſcribe this apparell to be dailie worne for decencie and order. But they ſay the Miniſters muſt be diſtinguiſhed from other men: and that they may be knowne off ther pariſhiners and church. This is euen as great a reaſon as the other. For iff they did ſet ſuche a ſhepheard ouer the ſheepfolde off god / who were able as well with his voice / as the ſheppherd with his hooke and ſtaffe / to rule his ſheepe / who were able alſo to heale the ſicke and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed / and to bringe home againe ſuche as wander and ſtraie out off the waie / finallie iff they ſet a right ſheppherd ouer the flocke / the ſheepe would knowe him by his voice / and would not need to haue any marke by his apparell to knowe him. Therfore allthoughe this reaſon might be off ſome force for hirelinges / yet it cannot be of any force for meete and worthie miniſters.</p>
            <p>And wheras they alledge alſo Order and decencye for there ſurplice / I would knowe whie yt ſhould ſeeme more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melie and decent for a Miniſter / that be ſhould preache or praie in a ſurpl ce / then in a gowne..

Further more do they not ſee that Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie liked our ſauior Chriſt / that the Goſpell is in a maner ſhadowed and couered by theſe vayles and figures / that by this meanes / the waie is made open to bringe in many other moo ceremonies for as good reſpectes as theſe be? do they not alſo think that we perceiue that nothing ells is ſought by this which they call comelines and order but only a conformitie w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ith Papiſtes and a ſuperſtitious decency? as alſo in vſing the ſigne off the croſſe in baptiſme / the rounde cake in the Lordes ſupper / and many other ſuche ceremonies / and not that ſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly order which the Apoſtle commandeth?<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14,40.</note> For iff the ſimplicitie and nakednes off the goſpell / miſliked them / why did they eſpecially clothe it with popiſhe apparell / ſeing we ought to be ſo muche the furder off and to abhorre ther doinges / by how muche we are in greater daunger off them / then off other heretiques becauſe they liue amonges vs? For which cauſe alſo the Lord commanded that greater ſeueritie ſhould be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt them off the land off Canaan / then againſt Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters off other nacions and cuntries.</p>
            <p>But they ſaie further / that men ſhould be admoniſhed that they are nowe vſed to an other ende / then they were by the Papiſtes / and that the abuſe cannot take awaye the right vſe off the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and althoughe the popiſhe prieſthoode be a moſt greu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous leproſie / yet the apparell which they vſed / iff yt be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed againe may be applied againe to our vſe, but I ſay / that off all the leprous garmentes / they haue choſen the filthieſt and moſt polluted: and ſuche as cannot be waſhed nor made cleane againe by anie art or conning off the fuller.

            <p>But they haue made me to longe in a matter off ſmall waight / who do ſo earneſtly vrge theſe trifles / as iff they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re matter off great waight and were grounded off the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement off God: But ſeinge yt appereth manifeſtly (as I ſuppoſe) by that which I haue ſaid that yt is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe / Let vs conclud / that noe certeine kinde / forme / or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion off apparell is to be preſcribed to miniſters neither to be dailie worne / nor yet in ſeruice tyme: and that they are only to be admoniſhed that they ſhewe them ſelues ſober / modeſt / and honeſt both in ther apparell a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in all the reſt off there life and conuerſation: which iff ſome ſhall neglect to doe / and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge admoniſhed by there breethren doe not amend yt / let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be corrected by the magiſtrate. And thus muche generallie off Biſhopps: that is to ſay off miniſters.</p>
            <p>Now it followeth to declare the diuers ſortes and kindes of them: and to ſhew what euery one hath proper and peculier to hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelffe.

For theſe are not to be confounded / as iff one and the ſelfe ſame office were
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19106:72"/> ſignified by two names / as ſome haue ſuppoſed. For ſeinge the Apoſtle in the iiij. to the Epheſians doth ſeuerally reherſe all the miniſters off the church which Chriſt hathe geuen and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the edifyinge theroff / and diſtinguiſheth Apoſtles from Prophets / and Prophetes from Euangeliſtes / I do not ſee why we ſhold not think alſo / that Paſtors and Doctors as they are diſtinguiſhed and ſeuered by name / to be ſo alſo in office and duty which alſo appereth more manifeſtly in the xij. to the Romans / wher they are diſtinguiſhed not only by names / but alſo by giftes proper to ſeuerall offices.

Wherfore / we ought to haue Paſtors and Doctors appointed in our churche / and not to reteine ſtill the extraordinary office off preachers: which yet I reproue more ſparingly / for the reſpect I haue to many wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thie men who haue labored with ſome fruite after this ſort: for I ſee that ſome (by the negligence off thoſe who ought to haue prouided meete Paſtors for the churches) for the loue they had vnto the goſpell / thought it lawfull for them in the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe tymes to take vpon them this Apoſtolicall or Euangelicall kind off office and embaſſage: wheras rather they owght to haue vrged the full and perfit reformacion off our churche / and to haue ſtriuen by the word off god / that euery church might haue bene prouided off a fit Paſtor. And that the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des heritage might be no more left barren and vntilled / left that at the laſt / the Lord be angry with vs / and take it from vs and let out his farme to other that will dreſſe it better.</p>
            <p>But iff there be any which pleaſe them ſelues to muche in this gadding abroade thorough out the churches / and will contend they may do ſo by the example off the Apoſtles and Euangeliſtes / let them ſhew vs the ſignes off ther Apoſtleſhip as Saint Paule did to the Corinthians:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.2.3.</note> Let them proue

Let them bring forthe the commiſſion off this theyr ſo large embaſſage to all churches: laſt off all let them proue that they are immediatly called therunto off god. For not only one Biſhopp but all the Biſhops in the world / are not able to ordeine and make and Apoſtle / ſeinge that (as it apperethe by the Argument I haue alleadged) ther office is allready ceaſed. They cannot be Euangeliſtes neither / ſeinge that they were as yt were the Legates off the Apoſtles / who in reſpect off them were as Proconſulles or Preſidentes. For Prophetes I think they will not ſay they be / ſeinge they cannot tell vs off thinges to come. Beſides that we reade not that the Prophetes went thus abroade thoroughe out all churches / but it ſeemethe rather that they were wont to abyde in certen places. Wherfore takinge away extraordinary cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges and vocations out off the ordinarie ſtate off the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che / Let vs follow that certeine rule which the Lord hathe preſcribed.

Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors therfore I call Biſhoppes who are occupied in the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple teachinge and expoundinge off the holie doctrine and trew Religion.

Therfore Paſtors adminiſtre not only the word / but alſo the Sacramentes. And ſeale vpp our ſaluacion with the Lordes ſignet / which they preache by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.

            <p>Further alſo this fault is made in the apointinge off pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors.

            <p>Thus now hauinge finiſhed one part off eccleſiaſticall functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and charges / namely that which conſiſteth in the du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie off a Biſhoppe and the Miniſterie off the worde / Let vs come to that which remaineth and concerneth deacons: But to the ende we may herei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo orderly procede / firſt / I ſay that Sainct Paule in his firſt epiſtle to Timothy and thyrd chap. and in the other places before alledged off me to the ſame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de calleth all thoſe Deacons / which do exerciſe any office or or charge in the churche / not belonging to the Miniſtery off the word. For ther be alſo other offices beſides the miniſtery off the word / needfull for the preſeruacion off the churche. Which what they be we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
            <p>But iff they were not neceſſary for the preſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> off the whole body / Surely Ieſus Chriſt the moſt wiſe ruler and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerner off his churche would neuer haue appointed them: yff then this other ordre off Deacons be ſo neceſſary / why do we want it wholie in our churche: deforminge the body no leſſe / yea a great deale more by ſo notable want off thoſe partes that are neceſſary / then by the ſuperfluitie off thoſe which are not off the body as hath bene allready before ſhewed.

            <p>Here I cannot ſufficiently wonder at the boldnes off the braine off man who thus altereth and peruerteth wholie / the lordes gouerment in his owne houſe: appointinge ſome beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des thoſe which are appointed by him / to the rulinge off his houſe: and putting out thoſe (as iff the church off god had no neede off ther labour) who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord him ſelffe had apointed / fynally licenſing them ſelues in the lords matters to ſet downe and take away / to adde and diminiſhe what they liſt / and to rule a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d diſpoſe all thinge according to ther owne will and fan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taſy: The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which ſeing ther ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be nothinge more againſt the honor off our Sauior / let vs at the laſt learne to be modeſt and to be ruled by his word: let vs ſuffer him to rule his owne hou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe by his owne authoritie and reſtore againe to the churche thoſe offices and functions / which he hath thought meete and profitable for it.</p>
            <p>But that thes thinges may be the better vnderſtood / and that we proceede the more orderly forewarde.

            <p>There be therfore ij. ſortes off Deacons as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided by Sainct Paule in the xij. to the Romans:<note place="margin">

            <p>How great cauſe there was off inſtitutinge this office in the churche / it appereath in the ſixth off the Actes / wher the the Apoſtles who in the beginninge adminiſtred the treaſury off the churche / when they perceiued that they were not able to ſerue bothe / that is to ſaye the preachinge off the word and the caringe for the pore / gaue ouer this office to be Treaſurers

That the poore might not be diſpiſed in the church off God whom he declareth to be ſo deare vnto hym / and that all complaintes being taken awaie / euery thing might be orderly and honeſtly gouerned in the houſe off God. Therfore the Treaſury off the church whither yt be in daily offringes / or in rentes and reuenuews appoynted to that ende is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto the Deacons. The hoſpitalles and houſes which are appointed for the reliefe off ſtraungers and off the poore are to be ruled by them: fynally / what other ſuche like thing ther is / belongeth to the office off De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acons.</p>
            <p>In olde tyme in deede in the prymitiue churche / this Treaſure was committed to the Biſhoppes / becauſe all men truſtinge to ther conſcience / whom they thought to haue a ſpeciall care off yt / hoped that all thinges wold be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re faithfully ordered for the benefit off the churche and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intenance off the poore: But they wheras they ought rather to haue followed the example off the Apoſtes / and to haue requeſted that they might geue them ſelues to preaching and praier / and that they would chooſe ſome other to take that charge vppon them / did not only ſuffer them ſelues to be entreated to take yt / But alſo did vnfaithfullie behaue them ſelues in diſpoſing the poore mens boxe / that at the laſt they ceaſed to be Almners any more or diſtributers vnto others / and as yff they had bene the poore men gaue all vnto them ſelues: concerning which matter the Deacons (iff we had any) ought to deale with the Biſhoppes in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halffe off the poore / (whoſe charge is committed vnto them by the churche) and enter an action againſt them for recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this mony againe: to requyre againe ther ſiluer veſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les

            <p>Therfore ſeinge the office off a Deacon is ſo neceſſary / yt may ſeme a merueile / how the churche could ſuffer that the poore and the ſtraungers / who for Chriſtes cauſe ought to be moſt deere vnto vs / ſhold want ther Gardyanes and Tutors.

Why are not handes laid vppon them / that they may knowe that they dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le in the Lordes buſines? Why are they not praid for / that they may haue grace to diſcharge there duty? Fynally why had they rather that they ſhould be cyuill then Eccleſiaſticall Officers? this therfore is the charge and office off Deacons: In whoſe Election and ordynacion / ſeing ther is nothing ells partyculerly to be conſidered beſydes that which hath bene Generallie ſpoken off all heretofore / Let vs come to the Elders which are the ſecond kind and ſort off Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.</p>

The other / where many haue but one and the ſame charge which they execute by common counſell and Authoritie. Wheroff againe the firſt ſort conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in ij. kindes / of Biſhopps (which expound and teache Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the ſeruice off god / that is <hi>Paſtors ad Doctors</hi>) and as many <hi>Deacons,</hi> (that is to ſay / <hi>Deacons &amp; Elders</hi> / ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led figuratiuely by names which are more generall. Off w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome go watche ouer the life a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> off all the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che / And the other are carefull to helpe the neceſſities off wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes / ſtraungers / ſick folk / and generallie off all the poore: ſo that both all the houſe is ſufficiently prouided for / aſwell touchinge the purity off faithe and doctrine / as the honeſtie
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:19106:101"/> and integritie off life and manners / and alſo the neede and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie off every one particulerly not neglected.</p>
            <p>Then / the conſiſtory or the Aſſembly off <hi>Elders</hi> which conſiſtethe of the three firſt and cheefe Officers off the church / <hi>Paſtors, Doctors, &amp; Elders,</hi> haue the chiefe care and charge off this commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealthe: to ſee that no office want his officer / and how faithfullie euery one beareth hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelfe in doinge off his office / regarding all with one eye / how offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes may be auoided / and how they may be remedied when they do ariſe / As for the placinge off euery one in his degree how honeſt and orderly ys it? wheras all do generally reuerence and reſpect the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly / for their Authoritie: And euery one knoweth his place and degree / and lifteth not him ſelfe / aboue his callinge: But the <hi>Deacons</hi> ſitting downe in the loweſt Roume / geue place vnto the Biſhopps / who ſitting as <hi>Stevvards</hi> off the Lordshouſe at the higher ende off the table / enuie not other officers to ſit together with them. And the Stewards alſo do ſo know them ſelues to beare the ſame office / that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>Paſtors</hi> go before / and the Doctors follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: After whom next be the <hi>Elders</hi> / and in the laſt place the <hi>Deacons</hi> / ſitting notwitſtandinge at the Officers table.</p>
            <p>As for euery mans garments and apparell / howe ſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are they / how meet for ther callinges / and how precious a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d excellent? The common Araie off them all / is a certen godlie and holie knowledge and profeſſion off Religion / and an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled life and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſacion: wherwith being clothed / as with thoſe white garmentes which <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> mencioneth in his reuelacion they need no cloth off gold our ſuche like coſtly apparell to ſet them out with all. Yet beſides this common Aray / euery one carieth the proper tokens and badges off his office: For the <hi>Biſhopps</hi> as the kinges ſtewardes in ſteade off ther ſtaues / haue ſounde knowledge of the ſcriptures / beſides which the <hi>Paſtors</hi> haue allſo that moui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d percinge ſpeeche / wherby they haue bothe power and authoritie to ſtrenghten

            <p>As for the reſt off the <hi>Deacons</hi> their ſeuerall ſignes and markes / are <hi>Diligence &amp; Symplicitie:</hi> Which ſo merueilous gouernment off the howſe off God / apointed by the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and heauenly wiſdome / ſeing it paſſethe aboue meaſure the ordre off Salomons houſe with the loue wheroff the Que<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ene off Saba was Rauiſhed / the God off all mercy graunt / that yt may muche more rauiſhe our moſt noble Queene and hir right honorable Counſellors with the love theroff then the other did the Queene off the Sowthe and hir Courtiers. For then ſhall we bee all moſt happy who liue in the churche as in the court off Chriſt our trewe Salomon when we may allwais ſtand in his preſence before him / and heare him ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke being the wiſdome off his Father: Then ſhall we confeſſe that king Salamon doth reigne in deede / and that all thinges are trew which the Prophetes propheſied touching his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome / when we ſee the churche in this ordre / when we ſee the Miniſters and officers theroff thus araied and apointed. For althoughe as we ſaie / the court is wher the king is / So alſo the church is wher as Chriſt is preſent: And allthoughe this be the cheifeſt end moſt principall / To heare the voice and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome off Salomon / yet it is not poſſible / that he ſhould tary any longe tyme in a place / that he appoint not and ſet in ordre his Court according to his heauenlie wiſdome.</p>
            <p>It may be that in time of his progreſſe / where he ſoiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth but for a ſhort tyme being ready by and by to depart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine / that this whole ordre and gouernment off his court can<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ot ſo well be ſeene and appeere: but it cannot be that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re he is purpoſed to dwell / and where he hath choſen a certen place to abyde and continewe in / that he ſet not all thinges in ordre according to his wiſdome / meeteſt both for his ſtate a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d maieſtie and for the perpetuitie off his reigne. For which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe I am the more a fraid / leſt that he be come into England / as
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:19106:102"/> into ſome caſtle in the waie off his progreſſe for a ſmall tyme vnles this confuſion and diſordre which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly followeth progreſſes be taken awaye / and a certeine and ſure ordre off gouerninge the churche be eſtabliſhed: for I cannot fullie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice in the ſtate off our churche / vntill that I ſee both for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſownde faithe and doctrine in Chriſt / and for diſcipline / a commely and meet order off gouerninge the churche / which Saint paule reioiſed to ſee in the churche off the Coloſſians. For the ſtable and perpetuall ſtate and condition off the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ſtandethe vpon theſe ij pillers.</p>
            <p>Wherfore I moſt humblie pray and beſeech all men that haue any care to preſerue and keepe the kingdome off Chriſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges vs / to deliuer the trew ſeruice and worſhipp off God to our poſteritie / that to their power euery one would ſeeke for this lawfull diſcipline off the churche which I haue deſcribed and bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As for me I bynd my ſelffe as it were by this Obligation to god and to the churche / that my labor and diligenc ſhall neuer be wanting in any thing that may helpe and furder by any meanes this reformation / which our Eyes daſell and our ſowles pyne away with ſo long looking and waiting for / which yff I may once ſee / I ſhall thinck that parte off any life the happieſt / wherin ſo great a benefit ſhall comme vnto the churche: but Iff I ſhall neuer ſee yt with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne eyes / yet I am glad / that I haue ſeene the forme and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne off it allready in my mind and left it to thoſe that ſhall come after and ſo by the example off <hi>Dauid and Ezechiel</hi> / whoſe condicion was not vnlyke in this behalffe / and by the teſtimony off my conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / that I haue diſchardged my dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to my God / and to our churche: I will reſt and confort my ſelffe herewithall / in the want off that which with ſo great deſyer I haue longed for.</p>
